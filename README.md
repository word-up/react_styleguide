# React Project Coding Guideline

An opinioned coding guideline for React + Redux project @WORD UP

## Naming

#### File name & Folder name

- Use dash to combine words for both file and folder name
  - `components/user-feedbacks.js`
  - `lib/api-parser.js`

#### Id & Class name

- Lowercase. Separated by single dash
  - `nav-bar-item`
- However, `__` & `--` is still fine if using [BEM](http://getbem.com/) style.
  - eg: `.block__elem--mod`

## File Structure

```
  |- pages/           -> direct handler for each route
    |- account/
      |- __test__/
      |- index.js
      |- styles.scss
  |- containers/      -> connect to store
    |- personal-info/
      |- __test__/
      |- index.js
      |- styles.scss
  |- components/
    |- personal-info/
      |- __test__/
      |- index.js
      |- styles.scss
  |- reducers/
    |- user/
      |- __test__/
      |- actions.js
      |- constants.js
      |- reducer.js
      |- selector.js
  |- styles/          -> common css like variable, mixin..
  |- utils/           -> helper function
```

## Spacing and Code Indentation

- Use 2 spaces for indentation instead of `tab`

## Code Comments and Inline Documentation

- Use backslash `// comments when necessary`
- For todos use the format `//TODO: (with the person responsible and reason)`
  - for example: `//TODO: (From Mark) hookup Ajax to rest server`

## React

#### Use multiple lines when we need to pass more than one props.

- Organize props by category.
  ```javascript
  <Input
    ref={(ref) => (this.BTN = ref)}
    onBlur={this.handleBlur}
    onChange={this.handleChange}
    height={height}
    width={width}
  />
  ```

#### Group `import` into sections

- In order to understand where's the code comes from, group all of `import` statements logically

  ```javascript
  // group 1: import javascript native or 3rd libraries
  import React;
  import moment;
  import styled from 'styled-components';

  // group 2: import modules like utilities, actions, reducers ...
  import { fetchCourseById } from 'Utils/apis/admin';
  import { toRoute } from 'Utils/route-handler';
  import { MODAL_TYPES } from 'lib/blog/modal';

  // group 3: import components
  import Loader from 'Components/generic-tools/loader';
  import ProductList from 'Components/product-list';
  const Form = dynamic(() => import('components/seo-page/modal-comps/form'));

  // group 4: import css, styles, class
  import classnames from 'classnames/bind';
  import styles from './styles.scss';
  ```

#### props

- should prevent using too many props in single component
- use proper naming ([reference](https://dlinau.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/how-to-name-props-for-react-components/))
  ```
  Array – use plural nouns. e.g. items
  Number – use prefix num or postfix count, index etc that can imply a number. e.g. numItems, itemCount, itemIndex
  Bool – use prefix is, can, has
    is: for visual/behavior variations. e.g. isVisible, isEnable, isActive
    can: fore behavior variations or conditional visual variations. e.g. canToggle, canExpand, canHaveCancelButton
    has: for toggling UI elements. e.g. hasCancelButton, hasHeader
  Object – use noun. e.g. item
  Node – use prefix node. containerNode
  Element – use prefix element. hoverElement
  ```

## Redux

#### Try to minimize the size of a reducer

- A giant reducer is hard to understand and also usually implies it has too many responsibilities. Having a smaller reducer also helps to make its corresponding actions smaller and more focued.
- We can use redux built in `#combineReducers` or [redux-immutable](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable) package
- [Refactoring Reducers Example](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/refactoring-reducers-example)
- [Using combineReducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers)

#### Container should not have views inside unless it's very simple.

- A container prepares data from store and dispatch actions and connected them to its component.

#### Use selectors to fetch specific data from Store.

- `user-info-selector.js` may provides `#get_full_name`, `#get_last_order` methods which talk to Store.
- Can also provides some reusable mutation functions.

  - [An example of using reusable state-mutation functions](https://tech.affirm.com/redux-patterns-and-anti-patterns-7d80ef3d53bc):

    ```javascript
    // utils.js
    const applyFn = (state, fn) => fn(state);
    export const pipe = (fns, state) =>
      state.withMutations((s) => fns.reduce(applyFn, s));

    // reducer.js
    return pipe(
      [mutate.closeModal, mutate.stopLoading, mutate.updateLoan(action.loan)],
      state
    );
    ```

#### All data in Store should be an immutable object created by `immutable.js` library

#### Data inside Store should be single source of truth

- No duplicated data in different entries. If there are multiple entities need to refer to the same data, use foreign key like in a database.

#### Try to keep data doesn't have more than 2 nested levels

- It's hard and error-prone to get/update data in a nested object. In addition, update data with a deep level will make several parent nodes being updated which may results in unnecessary render.
- Use [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) if needed.
- [Normalizing State Shape](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/normalizing-state-shape)

#### Combine `set` actions

- Instead of using `state.set('key1', value1).set('key2', 'value2')`, use `withMutations` to wrap multiple actions into one update. Since Immutable.js will perform re-arranging in all the processes and retain all intermediate states.
- eg: `state.withMutations(s => s.set('key1', value1).set('key2', 'value2'))`

#### Refrain from using `.toJS()`

- It's a resource demanding action and also we lose the performance benefit. In addition, every `toJS()` call results in a new object which will always trigger unnecessary render.

## General

#### Prefer single quote or backtick for String.

- `'a string'`
- `` `a string with ${variable}` ``

#### Prefer `async/await` than `Promise.then().error`

- The line of codes will be significantly lesser

#### Try as best as possible to avoid duplicated codes

#### Try as best as possible to avoid duplicated responsibilities

- Duplicated codes are easy to be identified. Though some codes are not the same, but actually doing similar tasks. In that case, think if they should be combined into a component or a module class.

#### Be careful of injecting global events/variables

- like `document.addEventlistener`.
  - Since we're in a SPA, remember to remove the listener at a proper timing like `componentDidUnmount`.
  - Take the parent/child tree into account. Don't add the same listener at both parents and children.

## eslint

apply `eslint-config-airbnb` with plugin `react` and `prettier`
